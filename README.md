# Chatbot
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>https://youtu.be/Szuw6wp0Jiw
#### Description: This is my cs50 final project. This project is about a basic chatbot . A chatbot is a computer program designed to simulate conversation with human users, especially over the Internet. This chatbot is created usinf HTML , CSS and Javascript. It is interactive in nature and can be used in websites for better customer services. 
  This project contains three files which are index.html, and in static folder two more files are present named css and scripts. In index.html the basic framework of the chatbot is programmed . In this file I have linked the css and scripts files. I have created various buttons and an input box where the user can enter and send the message to chat with the bot. In css file there are further two more files : chat.css and home.css. In chat.css I have written code to style the user text (changed font size , font width , added right alignment, added linear gradient look and etc) , bot text(changed font size , font width , added left alignment, added linear gradient look and etc) , background (added greyish look with centred text alignment etc) and chat bar(added linear gradient look, cursor-pointer , changed font size and etc). In home.css I have written code to add smooth scroll behaviour and added Helvetica, sans-serif, Arial font. In scripts there are two files chat.js and responses.js. Chat.js is basically programmed to :
                    ~ Gets the first message
                    ~ Retrieves the response
                    ~ Gets the text text from the input box and processes it
                    ~ Handles sending text via button clicks
  Responses.js is basically programmed to  give responses to the text entered by the user accordingly.
  This is all about my Final Project (Chatbot) . This chatbot can also play rock , paper , scissors with you. You can talk with it whenever you feel lonely. There is also a calculator programmed with this chatbot and one can perform basic calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division with it . If you send a heart emoji it will respond back with a heart emoji as well. This chatbot is a very basic one but took a lot of efforts to create. It is very fun to interact with. Various functions and commands are used. Chatbots are nowdays used in various websites for better user experience. User can ask faqs and get their problems solved using chatbot . I had very fun time creating this on. Hope you will have a fun time intereacting with it :)
